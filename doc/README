Welcome to the Linux-HA heartbeat code
It works, and it can actually do quite a bit.
It can do 2-node IP takeover for an unlimited number of IP interfaces.

It heartbeats over:
	unadorned serial links arranged in a ring topology
	UDP/IP broadcast heartbeats over ethernet (or similar)
	UDP/IP multicast heartbeats over ethernet (or similar)
	special "ping" heartbeats to routers, etc.

After installing this package, you'll have to make some HA config files
in /etc/ha.d.  Samples of these config files are found in the doc directory.
These files are named:
	ha.cf
and	haresources

The beginnings of a Hardware Installation guide can also be found under
the doc directory as:
	HardwareGuide.html or HardwareGuide.txt (take your pick)

The beginnings of a Getting Started Guide can also be found under
	GettingStarted.txt or GettingStarted.html (take your pick)

For more info on Linux-HA, I recommend you read the Linux-HA web page.
It can be found at:
	http://linux-ha.org/

The pages found there also document this software and current thinking
about plans for the future, etc.
