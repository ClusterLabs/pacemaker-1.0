<h1>
Linux-HA Project Task List</h1>
This page describes a set of Linux-HA Phase I activities that need to be
done.&nbsp; There is also a documentation team whose activities I haven't
listed here, because I don't know enough about what needs to be done and
how it should be done to break it up into distinct tasks.
<p>The purpose of this list is to track all the things we think need doing,
and hopefully match them up to people who will do them.&nbsp; <i><b>Perhaps
you?</b>&nbsp; </i>If you see a task you are interested in, or want to
add tasks to the list or comment on it, contact
<a href="mailto:alanr@unix.sh">Alan Robertson</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Organization of Activities</h2>
Linux-HA phase I is divided into three basic areas:
<ol>
<li>
Heartbeat and cluster management services</li>

<li>HA resource implementations</li>

<li>
Diagnostics</li>
</ol>

<h2>High-Priority Jobs</h2>
These are the jobs I feel strongly need to be done soon:
<ul>
<li>	SharedFS
	</li>
<li>	DRBD (needs fixing)
	</li>
<li>	NFS
	</li>
<li>	Samba
	</li>
<li>	Oracle
	</li>
<li>	PostgreSQL
	</li>
<li>	CMsplit
	</li>
<li>	ResourceMon
	</li>
<li>	Status GUI
	</li>
<li>	Automake/Autobuild
	</li>
</ul>
Volunteers willing to tackle these head-on soon would be very much
appreciated.
<h2>
HA Resource Implementations</h2>
Anything that can move from one machine to another (processes, IP addresses,
MAC addresses, filesystems) are implemented as resources.&nbsp; Lots of
interesting activities fall under this category.&nbsp; For example, IP
address takeover is in this category, filesystem replication and takeover
is in this category.&nbsp; Lots of things are implemented as resources.&nbsp;
This is where we get into properly handling the great diversity of things
that people want to put into HA systems.&nbsp; Some of these resource types
will require specialized hardware to test.&nbsp; If you want to see a particular
configuration supported, you may have to create the resource for it.
<p>Resources are basically objects with four member functions:
<ul>
<li>
<b>start</b> - enable or take over the resource</li>

<li>
<b>stop</b> - disable or give up the resource</li>

<li>
<b>status</b> - tell whether the resource is currently enabled</li>

<li>
<b>info</b> - provide human-readable information about the resource type
(used by GUI configuration tools, etc.)</li>
</ul>

ReiserFS.  You'll need to get the latest nfs-utils package for this one.
The folks at MC Linux and SGI have both implemented this and may be of some help.

Good to consult with Jeremy Allison or one of the other Samba principals.

<h2>
Diagnostics Activities</h2>
Linux-HA Phase I needs a diagnostics subsystem to notice and handle things
like hardware and software failures that aren't complete node failures.&nbsp;
This is where that will be carried out.

Heartbeat and Cluster Manager Activities</h2>
These things are at the heart of Linux-HA.&nbsp; You'll notice that many

		shutdown, and not rely on the scripts that call it to
		do that.  It's probably OK to use scripts in the process,
		but starting heartbeat by itself should cause resources
		to be acquired, and killing it should cause them to be

This would allow people with secure networks to use crc without encryption,
people in a more hostile environment could use HMAC-SHA1 with a
shared secret, etc.
