#	Authentication file.  Must be mode 600
#
#
#	Must have exactly one auth directive at the front.
#	auth	send authentication using this method-id
#
#	Then, list the method and key that go with that method-id
#
#	Available methods: crc sha1, md5.  Crc doesn't need/want a key.
#
#	You normally only have one authentication method-id listed in this file
#
#	Put more than one to make a smooth transition when changing auth
#	methods and/or keys.
#
#
#	sha1 is believed to be the "best", md5 next best.
#
#	crc adds no security, except from packet corruption.
#		Use only on physically secure networks.
