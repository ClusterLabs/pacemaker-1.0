.TP 8
.BI \-\-help,\ \-?
this help message
.TP 8
.BI \-\-verbose,\ \-V
turn on debug info. additional instances increase verbosity
.TP 8
.BI \-\-quiet,\ \-Q

.SS COMMANDS
.TP 8
.BI \-\-list,\ \-L
List all resources
.TP 8
.BI \-\-query\-xml,\ \-x
Query a resource.

Requires: \fB\-r\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-locate,\ \-W
Locate a resource.

Requires: \fB\-r\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-migrate,\ \-M
Migrate a resource from it current location.

Use \fB\-H\fP to specify a destination.  If \fB\-H\fP is not specified, we will force the resource to move by creating a rule for the current location and a score of \-INFINITY

\fBNOTE:\fP This will prevent the resource from running on this node until the constraint is removed with \fB\-U\fP

Requires: \fB\-r\fP, Optional: \fB\-H\fP, \fB\-f\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-un\-migrate,\ \-U
Remove all constraints created by \fB\-M\fP

Requires: \fB\-r\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-delete,\ \-D
Delete a resource from the CIB.

Requires: \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-t\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-cleanup,\ \-C
Delete a resource from the LRM.

Requires: \fB\-r\fP.  Optional: \fB\-H\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-reprobe,\ \-P
Recheck for resources started outside of the CRM.

Optional: \fB\-H\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-refresh,\ \-R
Refresh the CIB from the LRM.

Optional: \fB\-H\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-set\-parameter\  string ,\ \-p\  string
Set the named parameter for a resource.

Requires: \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-v\fP.  Optional: \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-s\fP

Get the named property (eg. class, type, is_managed) a resource.

Requires: \fB\-r\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-\-set\-property\  string ,\ \-S\  string

Requires: \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-v\fP
.SS OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI \-\-resource\  string ,\ \-r\  string
Resource ID
.TP 8
.BI \-\-resource\-type\  string ,\ \-t\  string
Resource type (primitive, clone, group, ...)
.TP 8
.BI \-\-property\-value\  string ,\ \-v\  string

This should be used if the resource's stickiness and constraint scores total more than INFINITY (Currently 10,000)

\fBNOTE:\fP This will prevent the resource from running on this node until the constraint is removed with \fB\-U\fP
.TP 8
