    <para>
      The purpose of this document is to definitively explain the concepts used to configure Pacemaker.
      To achieve this best, it will focus exclusively on the XML syntax used to configure the CIB.
    </para>
    <para>
      For those that are allergic to XML, Pacemaker comes with a cluster shell and a Python based GUI exists, however these tools will not be covered at all in this document
      <footnote>
	<para>It is hoped however, that having understood the concepts explained here, that the functionality of these tools will also be more readily understood.</para>
      </footnote>
      , precisely because they hide the XML.
    </para>
    <para>
      Additionally, this document is NOT a step-by-step how-to guide for configuring a specific clustering scenario.
      Although such guides exist, the purpose of this document is to provide an understanding of the building blocks that can be used to construct any type of Pacemaker cluster.
