The ldirectord is a stand-alone daemon to monitor services of real
servers, currently http, https and ftp service. It is simple to
install and works with the heartbeat code (http://www.linux-ha.org/).

See 'ldirectord -h' for all the information about ldirectord.
See linux-ha/doc/ldirectord for more information.

If You have to check only for some kind of the possible services
You must not install all of the Perl libraries LWP::UserAgent, 
Net::SSLeay, Net::FTP, simply comment out the functions You dont
need, check_http, check_https or check_ftp.

RPMS of these modules are available from
