# Non-standard values.
#
# OCF does not include the concept of master/slave resources so we
#   need to extend it so we can discover a resource's complete state.
#
# OCF_RUNNING_MASTER:  
#    The resource is in "master" mode and fully operational
# OCF_FAILED_MASTER:
#    The resource is in "master" mode but in a failed state
# 
# The extra two values should only be used during a probe.
#
# Probes are used to discover resources that were started outside of
#    the CRM and/or left behind if the LRM fails.
# 
# They can be identified in RA scripts by checking for:
#   [ "${__OCF_ACTION}" = "monitor" -a "${OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_interval}" = "0" ]
# 
# Failed "slaves" should continue to use: OCF_ERR_GENERIC
# Fully operational "slaves" should continue to use: OCF_SUCCESS
#
