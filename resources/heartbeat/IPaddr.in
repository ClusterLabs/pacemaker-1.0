#	This script manages IP alias IP addresses
#
#	It can add an IP alias, or remove one.
#
#	usage: $0 <ip-address> {start|stop|status|monitor}
#
#	The "start" arg adds an IP alias.
#
#	Surprisingly, the "stop" arg removes one.	:-)

	Argument=IP address OR IP address/broadcast address OR IP address/broadcast address/netmaskbits
	Description:
	An IPaddr resource is an IP address which is to be taken over by \\
	the owning node.  An argument is required, and is of this form:
	    nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb
	Where nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn is the IP address to be taken over, and\\
	bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb is the broadcast address to be used with this address.

	Since IPaddr is the "default" resource type, it is not necessary\\
	to prefix the IP address by "IPaddr::".
	This allows IPaddr::192.2.4.63 to be abbreviated as 192.2.4.63.
