# Filesystem
#      Description: Manages a Filesystem on a shared storage medium.
#  Original Author: Eric Z. Ayers (eric.ayers@compgen.com)
# Original Release: 25 Oct 2000
#          Support: linux-ha-dev@lists.tummy.com
#
# usage: ./Filesystem <device> <directory> <fstype> [<options>] {start|stop|status}
#
#<device>    : name of block device for the filesystem. e.g. /dev/sda1, /dev/md0
#		Or a -U or -L option for mount, or an NFS mount specification
#<directory> : the mount point for the filesystem
#<fstype>    : name of the filesystem type. e.g. ext2
#<options>   : options to be given to the mount command via -o
#
#
# An example usage in /etc/ha.d/haresources: 
#       node1  10.0.0.170 Filesystem::/dev/sda1::/data1::ext2
#  or
#       node1  10.0.0.170 Filesystem::-Ldata1::/data1::ext2
#  or
#       node1  10.0.0.170 Filesystem::server:/data1::/data1::nfs::ro
#
# This assumes you want to manage a filesystem on a shared (scsi) bus.
# Do not put this filesystem in /etc/fstab.  This script manages all of
# that for you.
#
# If you are interested in High Availability, you will probably also want
# some sort of external hardware RAID controller in front of the actual 
# disks.  I don't mean a RAID controller embedded in the host controller -
# it has to be a external controller.
#
# It can also be an internal RAID controller if the controller supports
# failover.  IBM's ServeRAID controller does this, and it automatically
# prohibits concurrent access too, so it's pretty cool in this application.
#
# There is a script for software RAID-1 included in this directory.  Right 
# now, I wouldn't recommend using software RAID (see notes in the Raid1 script)
#
# NOTE: There is no locking (such as a SCSI reservation) being done here.
#       I would if the SCSI driver could properly maintain the reservation,
#       which it cannot, even with the 'scsi reservation' patch submitted
#       earlier this year by James Bottomley.  The patch minimizes the
#       bus resets caused by a RESERVATION_CONFLICT return, and helps the 
#       reservation stay when 2 nodes contend for a reservation, 
#       but it does not attempt to recover the reservation in the 
#       case of a bus reset.  
#
#       What all this means is that if 2 nodes mount the same file system
#       read-write, the filesystem is going to become corrupted.
#
#	As a result, you should use this together with the stonith option
#	and redundant, independent communications paths.
#
#	If you don't do this, don't blame us when you scramble your disk.
# 
#	Note:  the ServeRAID controller does prohibit concurrent acess
#	In this case, you don't actually need STONITH, but redundant comm is
#	still an excellent idea.
