# usage: ./ServeRAID <adapter> <MergeGroup#>  (start|stop|status)
#
#<adapter>:	Adapter number of the ServeRAID adapter 
#<MergeGroup#>:	MergeGroup # of the logical drive under consideration.
#
#
# The ServeRAID clustering model is a bit odd, and its terminology needs
# a little explanation
#
#	Logical Volume - a particular SCSI id {target id and LUN} on
#		a particular controller.
#
#	Merge Group - when active on one side or the other of the ServeRAID
#		configuration it corresponds with a logical drive.
#		Merge group numbers are permanently assigned to a particular
#		chunk of storage.  Shared merge groups are in the
#		range of 1 to 8, and are largely arbitrary.
#		Unshared merge groups start at 200.
#		We can only deal with shared merge groups.  When a merge
#		group is activated on one of the controllers, it becomes
#		a logical volume on that system.  NOTE:  The order in
#		which the Merge Groups are activated determines which
#		SCSI Ids they become.  This makes for extra headaches
#		for this script to deal with.  It also means that if
#		you have more than one shared ServeRAID merge group on
#		a particular controller, that the SCSI IDs will not
#		be constant.  This requires mounting by uuid or label.
#
#	One of the ServerRAID controllers has to be configured with
#	SCSI initiator ID 6, and the other with SCSI id 7.
#
#	At this time, the ServeRAID clustering solution only works with
#	RAID 1 setups.  It does NOT support RAID 5.  This is a firmware
#	bug in the ServeRAID where it doesn't fail over correctly
#	if the RAID5 array is in a critical state...
#
#	Note that this script requires ServeRAID software version 6.10 or
#	later.  This software is now available from IBM.
#
# An example usage in /etc/ha.d/haresources: 
#       node1  10.0.0.170 ServeRAID::1::1
#
unset LC_ALL; export LC_ALL
unset LANGUAGE; export LANGUAGE

#	Older ServeRAID utility returns 1 when it succeeds (weird)
#	BUT - the newly released version is more normal...

usage() {
  cat <<-! >&1
	usage: $0 <serveraid#> <sharedmergegroup#> (start|stop|status)

	The serveraid# is the number of the ServeRAID adapter
	ServeRAID adapters are numbered starting from 1.

	The shared merge group number is a number between 1 and 8 inclusive.
	It indicates to the controller which logical disk to fail over.

                node1  10.0.0.170 ServeRAID::1::1

	PREREQUISITES:
	You must configure your ServeRAID adapters for clustering for this
	to work.

	To do this, you must use the bootable "ServeRAID Support CD" and right
	click your controller and pick "configure for clustering".  The Linux
	version of the ServeRAID manager does not have the "configure for
	clustering" option.

	You will need at least version 6.10 (~July 2003 release) of the ipssend
	command for this script to work.

	For the time being, you will need to grab a "correct" version of
	the ipssend command here:
	        http://linux-ha.org/download/ipssend.gz

	NOTE: This a temporary URL which will go away once the official
	version becomes available.
