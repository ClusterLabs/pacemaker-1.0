	For the single server edition of WAS:
	usage: $0 <WAS-configuration file> ($methods)
	usage: $0 methods

	For the advanced edition of WAS:
	usage: $0 <WAS-(snoop)-port-number> ($methods)
	usage: $0 methods

	$0 manages a Websphere Application Server (WAS) as an HA resource

	The 'start' operation starts WAS.
	The 'stop' operation stops WAS.
	The 'status' operation reports whether WAS is running
	The 'monitor' operation reports whether the WAS seems to be working
		(httpd also needs to be working for this case)
	The 'methods' operation reports on the methods $0 supports

	This is known to work with the Single Server edition of Websphere,
	and is believed to work with the Advanced edition too.
	Since the Advanced Edition has no configuration file (it's in a the
	database) you need to give a port number instead of a
	configuration file for this config parameter.

	The default configuration file for the single server edition is:
	$DEFAULT

	The default snoop-port for the advanced edition is: $DEFAULT_WASPORTS

	The start and stop operations must be run as root.

	The status operation will report a pid of "-" for the
	WAS root process using unless it is run as root.

	If you don't have xmllint on your system, parsing of WAS
	configuration files is very primitive.
	In this case, the port specification we need from the XML
	config file has to be on the same line as the
	first part of the <transports/> tag.

	We run servlet/snoop on the first transport port listed in
	the config file for the "monitor" operation.
