#	It can add a preferred source address, or remove one.
#
#	usage: IPsrcaddr ip-address {start|stop|status|monitor}
#
#	The "start" arg adds a preferred source address.
#
#	Surprisingly, the "stop" arg removes it.	:-)
#
#	NOTES:
#
#	1) There must be exactly one default route!
#	2) The script depends on Alexey Kuznetsov's ip utility from the
#	iproute aka iproute2 package.
#	3) No checking is done to see if the passed in IP address can
#	reasonably be associated with the interface on which the default
#	route exists.  So unless you want to deliberately spoof your source IP,
#	check it!  Normally, I would expect that your haresources looks
#	something like:
#
#		nodename ip1 ip2 ... ipN IPsrcaddr::ipX
#
#	where ipX is one of the ip1 to ipN.
