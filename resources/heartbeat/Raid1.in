# usage: $0 <raidtab_config_file> <md_dev_name> {start|stop|status}
#
# in /etc/ha.d/haresources, use a line such as:
# nodea  10.0.0.170 Raid1::/etc/raidtab.md0::/dev/md0 Filesystem::/dev/md0::/data1::ext2
#
# This script assumes you are running the so-called RAID v.90 patches vs.
# the Linux 2.2 kernel (distributed with RedHat 6.2).   I have not used 
# kernel version 2.4.   
#
# The "start" arg starts up the raid device
# The "stop" arg stops it.  NOTE: all filesystems must be unmounted
#  and no processes should be accessing the device.
# The "status" arg just prints out whether the device is running or not
#
# 
# DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk!
#
#  Besides all of the usual legalese that accompanies free software, 
#  I will warn you that I do not yet use this kind of setup (software RAID 
#  over shared storage) in production, and I have reservations about doing so.
#
#  The linux md driver/scsi drivers under Raid 0.90 and kernel version 2.2 
#  do not behave well when a drive is in the process of going bad.  
#  The kernel slows down, but doesn't completely crash.  This is about the 
#  worst possible thing that could happen in an un-attended HA type 
#  environment.  (Once the system is rebooted, the sofware raid stuff works 
#  like a champ.)  
#  My other reservation has to do with the interation of RAID recovery with 
#  journaling filesystems and other parts of the kernel.  Subscribe to 
#  linux-raid@vger.kernel.org  for other opinions and possible solutions.

# 
# SETUP:
#
# You might need to pass the command line parameter: raid=noautodetect 
# in an HA environment so that the kernel doesn't automatically start
# up your raid partitions when you boot the node.  This means that it isn't
# going to work to use RAID for the system disks and the shared disks.
#
# 0) partition the disks to use for RAID.  Use normal Linux partition 
#     types, not the RAID autodetect type for your partitions.
# 1) Create /etc/raidtab.md?  on both systems (see example file below)
# 2) Initialize your raid partition with 
#     /sbin/mkraid --configfile /etc/raidtab.md? /dev/md?
# 3) Format your filesystem
#     mke2fs /dev/md0  # for ext2fs... a journaling filesystem would be nice
# 3) Create the mount point on both systems.
#     DO NOT add your raid filesystem to /etc/fstab
# 4) copy this script (to /etc/rc.d/init.d if you wish) and edit it to
#    reflect your desired settings.
# 5) Modify the heartbeat 'haresources' setup file
# 6) unmount the filesystem and stop the raid device with 'raidstop'
# 7) fire up heartbeat!
#
# 
# EXAMPLE config file /etc/raidtab.md0
# This file must exist on both machines!
#
#  raiddev		    /dev/md0
#  raid-level		    1
#  nr-raid-disks		    2
#  chunk-size		    64k
#  persistent-superblock	    1
#  #nr-spare-disks	    0
#    device	    /dev/sda1
#    raid-disk     0
#    device	    /dev/sdb1
#    raid-disk     1
