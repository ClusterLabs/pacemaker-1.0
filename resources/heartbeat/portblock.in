	usage: $CMD {udp|tcp} portno,portno {block|unblock} {start|stop|status}

	$CMD is used to temporarily block ports using iptables.

	It can be used to turn off a port before bringing
	up an IP address, and enable it after a service is started.
	To do that for samba, the following resource line can be used:

	$CMD::tcp::137,138::block		\\
	    10.10.10.20				\\
	    nmbd smbd 				\\
	    $CMD::tcp::137,138::unblock

	This will do the follwing things:

	  - DROP all incoming packets for TCP ports 137 and 138
	  - Bring up the IP alias 10.10.10.20
	  - start the nmbd and smbd services
	  - Re-enable TCP ports 137 and 138
	        (enable normal firewall rules on those ports)

	This prevents clients from getting ICMP port unreachable
	if they try to reconnect to the service after the alias is
	enabled but before nmbd and smbd are running.  These packets
	will cause some clients to give up attempting to reconnect to
	the server.

	NOTE:  iptables is linux-specific...
