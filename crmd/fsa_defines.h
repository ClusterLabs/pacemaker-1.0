	A state diagram can be constructed from the dc_fsa.dot with the
	following command:

	dot -Tpng crmd_fsa.dot > crmd_fsa.png

Description:

      Once we start and do some basic sanity checks, we go into the
      S_NOT_DC state and await instructions from the DC or input from
      the CCM which indicates the election algorithm needs to run.

      If the election algorithm is triggered we enter the S_ELECTION state
      from where we can either go back to the S_NOT_DC state or progress
      to the S_INTEGRATION state (or S_RELEASE_DC if we used to be the DC
      but arent anymore).

      The election algorithm has been adapted from
      http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR521

      Loosly known as the Bully Algorithm, its major points are:
      - Election is initiated by any node (N) notices that the coordinator
	is no longer responding
      - Concurrent multiple elections are possible
      - Algorithm
	  + N sends ELECTION messages to all nodes that occur earlier in
	  the CCM's membership list.
	  + If no one responds, N wins and becomes coordinator
	  + N sends out COORDINATOR messages to all other nodes in the
	  partition
	  + If one of higher-ups answers, it takes over. N is done.
      
      Once the election is complete, if we are the DC, we enter the
      S_INTEGRATION state which is a DC-in-waiting style state.  We are
      the DC, but we shouldnt do anything yet because we may not have an
      up-to-date picture of the cluster.  There may of course be times
      when this fails, so we should go back to the S_RECOVERY stage and
      check everything is ok.  We may also end up here if a new node came
      online, since each node is authorative on itself and we would want
      to incorporate its information into the CIB.

      Once we have the latest CIB, we then enter the S_POLICY_ENGINE state
      where invoke the Policy Engine. It is possible that between
      invoking the Policy Engine and recieving an answer, that we recieve
      more input. In this case we would discard the orginal result and
      invoke it again.

      Once we are satisfied with the output from the Policy Engine we
      enter S_TRANSITION_ENGINE and feed the Policy Engine's output to the
      Transition Engine who attempts to make the Policy Engine's
      calculation a reality.  If the transition completes successfully,
      we enter S_IDLE, otherwise we go back to S_POLICY_ENGINE with the
      current unstable state and try again.
      
      Of course we may be asked to shutdown at any time, however we must
      progress to S_NOT_DC before doing so.  Once we have handed over DC
      duties to another node, we can then shut down like everyone else,
      that is by asking the DC for permission and waiting it to take all
      our resources away.

      The case where we are the DC and the only node in the cluster is a
      special case and handled as an escalation which takes us to
      S_SHUTDOWN.  Similarly if any other point in the shutdown
      fails or stalls, this is escalated and we end up in S_TERMINATE.

      At any point, the CRMd/DC can relay messages for its sub-systems,
      but outbound messages (from sub-systems) should probably be blocked
      until S_INTEGRATION (for the DC case) or the join protocol has
      completed (for the CRMd case)
