	$0 manages the availability of a SCSI device from the point
	of view of the linux kernel.  It make Linux believe the
	device has gone away, and it can make it come back again.

	The purpose of this resource script is to keep admins from
	accidentally messing with a shared disk that is managed by the
	HA subsystem and is currently owned by the other side.

	To get maximum benefit from this feature, you should (manually)
	disable the resources on boot, and let your HA software enable
	them when it wants to acquire the disk.
	
	The kernel code says this is potentially dangerous.  DO NOT USE
	IT ON AN ACTIVE DEVICE.  If the device is inactive, this script
	will make it stay inactive, when given "off".  If you inactivate
	the wrong device, you may have to reboot your machine, and your
	data may take a hit.

	On the other hand, at least one RAID controller requires the
	use of this technique for it to work correctly in a failover
	environment - so it is believed that it is more stable in this
	usage than the comments in the code imply.

	Here are the warnings from the kernel source about the "stop"
	operation as of 2.4.10:

	------------------------------
	Consider this feature pre-BETA.
	    CAUTION: This is not for hotplugging your peripherals. As
	    SCSI was not designed for this, you could damage your
	    hardware and thoroughly confuse the SCSI subsystem.

	Similar warnings apply to the "start" operation...

	 Consider this feature BETA.
	     CAUTION: This is not for hotplugging your peripherals.
	     As SCSI was not designed for this you could damage your
	     hardware !
	However perhaps it is legal to switch on an already connected
	device. It is perhaps not guaranteed this device doesn't corrupt
	an ongoing data transfer.
	-------------------------

	So, Caveat Emptor, and test this feature thoroughly on
	your kernel and your configuration with real load on the SCSI
	bus before using it in production!

	Another potential trouble spot...
	The order in which you bring up LinuxSCSI resources determines which
	SCSI device they show up as on Linux.  If you have two SCSI devices
	in different resource groups they will be brought up asyncronously
	resulting in indeterminate device name assignments.  This usually
	happens in an active-active configuration.
	
	To solve this you probably should use LVM or EVMS to manage these
	volumes.  LVM and EVMS solve this problem for you by labels they
	keep in the volumes.  If you don't use a reasonable volume manager,
	then you'll have to mount by UUID.
