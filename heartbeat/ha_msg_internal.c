/*
 * $Log: ha_msg_internal.c,v $
 * Revision 1.52  2005/03/04 15:34:59  alan
 * Fixed various signed/unsigned errors...
 *
 * Revision 1.51  2005/02/14 21:06:10  gshi
 * BEAM fix:
 *
 * replacing the binary usage in core code with uuid function
 *
 * Revision 1.50  2005/02/11 05:06:01  alan
 * Undid some accidental (but sloppy) name-mangling by alsoran...
 *
 * Revision 1.49  2005/02/08 08:10:27  gshi
 * change the way stringlen and netstringlen is computed.
 *
 * Now it is computed resursively in child messages in get_stringlen() and get_netstringlen()
 * so it allows changing child messages dynamically.
 *
 * Revision 1.48  2005/01/18 20:33:03  andrew
 * Appologies for the top-level commit, one change necessitated another which
 *   exposed some bugs... etc etc
 *
 * Remove redundant usage of XML in the CRM
 * - switch to "struct ha_msg" aka. HA_Message for everything except data
 * Make sure the expected type of all FSA input data is verified before processing
 * Fix a number of bugs including
 * - looking in the wrong place for the API result data in the CIB API
 *   (hideous that this actually worked).
 * - not overwriting error codes when sending the result to the client in the CIB API
 *   (this lead to some error cases being treated as successes later in the code)
 * Add PID to log messages sent to files (not to syslog)
 * Add a log level to calls for cl_log_message()
 * - convert existing calls, sorry if I got the level wrong
 * Add some checks in cl_msg.c code to prevent NULL pointer exceptions
 * - usually when NULL is passed to strlen() or similar
 *
 * Revision 1.47  2004/08/31 17:35:13  alan
 * Put in a "be quiet on format errors" change I had missed before...
 *
 * Revision 1.46  2004/08/29 04:33:41  msoffen
 * Fixed comments to properly compile
 *
 * Revision 1.45  2004/08/29 03:01:12  msoffen
 * Replaced all // COMMENTs with / * COMMENT * /
 *
 * Revision 1.44  2004/07/26 12:39:46  andrew
 * Change the type of some int's to size_t to stop OSX complaining
 *
 * Revision 1.43  2004/07/07 19:07:14  gshi
 * implemented uuid as nodeid
 *
 * Revision 1.42  2004/03/25 07:55:39  alan
 * Moved heartbeat libraries to the lib directory.
 *
 * Revision 1.41  2004/03/03 05:31:50  alan
 * Put in Gochun Shi's new netstrings on-the-wire data format code.
 * this allows sending binary data, among many other things!
 *
 * Revision 1.40  2004/02/17 22:11:57  lars
 * Pet peeve removal: _Id et al now gone, replaced with consistent Id header.
 *
 * Revision 1.39  2003/12/19 17:28:01  alan
 * Incorporated a patch from Guochun Shi <gshi@ncsa.uiuc.edu> to allow
 * the authentication facility to be able to authenticate binary messages.
 *
 * Revision 1.38  2003/11/10 08:55:20  lars
 * Bugfixes by Deng, Pan:
 *
 * - While receiving a ha_msg, the default number of fields is MINFIELDS,
 *   which is 20. After the reception, if more than 20 fields needed to be
 *   added, it will fail.  I changed the MINFIELDS to 30. It is not a
 *   graceful fix, but it can work for checkpoint service. I think the max
 *   fields should not be fixed.
 *
 * - The message create routine ha_msg_new() in ha_msg.c. It takes a
 *   parameter nfields, but the function does not use it at all. If nfields
 *   > MINFIELDS, the allocated fields should be nfields.
 *
 * Revision 1.37  2003/07/03 21:50:40  alan
 * Changed the function which adds the "from" address to not use uname, but
 * the already-computed localnodename variable.
 *
 * Revision 1.36  2003/05/30 15:22:11  kevin
 * Fix building on OpenBSD
 *
 * Revision 1.35  2003/04/18 06:09:46  alan
 * Fixed an off-by-one error in writing messages to the FIFO.
 * Also got rid of some now-unused functions, and fixed a minor glitch in BasicSanitCheck.
 *
 * Revision 1.34  2003/04/15 23:06:53  alan
 * Lots of new code to support the semi-massive process restructuriing.
 *
 * Revision 1.33  2003/03/29 02:48:44  alan
 * More small changes on the road to restructuring heartbeat processees.
 *
 * Revision 1.32  2003/02/07 08:37:16  horms
 * Removed inclusion of portability.h from .h files
 * so that it does not need to be installed.
 *
 * Revision 1.31  2003/02/05 09:06:33  horms
 * Lars put a lot of work into making sure that portability.h
 * is included first, everywhere. However this broke a few
 * things when building against heartbeat headers that
 * have been installed (usually somewhere under /usr/include or
 * /usr/local/include).
 *
 * This patch should resolve this problem without undoing all of
 * Lars's hard work.
 *
 * As an asside: I think that portability.h is a virus that has
 * infected all of heartbeat's code and now must also infect all
 * code that builds against heartbeat. I wish that it didn't need
 * to be included all over the place. Especially in headers to
 * be installed on the system. However, I respect Lars's opinion
 * that this is the best way to resolve some weird build problems
 * in the current tree.
 *
 * Revision 1.30  2003/01/31 10:02:09  lars
 * Various small code cleanups:
 * - Lots of "signed vs unsigned" comparison fixes
 * - time_t globally replaced with TIME_T
 * - All seqnos moved to "seqno_t", which defaults to unsigned long
 * - DIMOF() definition centralized to portability.h and typecast to int
 * - EOS define moved to portability.h
 * - dropped inclusion of signal.h from stonith.h, so that sigignore is
 *   properly defined
 *
 * Revision 1.29  2002/10/22 13:18:58  alan
 * Changed a few calls to ha_error(... to ha_log(LOG_ERR,...
 *
 * Revision 1.28  2002/10/21 14:31:17  msoffen
 * Additional debug to find actual cause of empty packets.
 *
 * Revision 1.27  2002/10/21 10:17:18  horms
 * hb api clients may now be built outside of the heartbeat tree
 *
 * Revision 1.26  2002/09/24 17:24:46  msoffen
 * Changed to log the bogus packet and accept blank packets / carriage returns
 * and just return.
 *
 * Revision 1.25  2002/09/17 18:53:37  alan
 * Put in a fix to keep mach_down from doing anything with ping node information.
 * Also put in a change to make lmb's last portability fix more portable ;-)
 *
 * Revision 1.24  2002/09/17 17:08:00  lars
 * strlen() returns size_t and requires %zd instead of %d in *printf() according
 * to ISO C. (Portability fix to compile on size_t != int archs)
 *
 * Revision 1.23  2002/09/13 14:47:46  alan
 * Put in a workaround for an annoying message we get in FreeBSD...
 *
 * Revision 1.22  2002/09/13 05:24:13  alan
 * Put in some debugging code for Matt Soffen in FreeBSD.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  2002/08/10 02:10:24  alan
 * Changed it so that it's impossible to get an extra newline in the output
 * from /proc/loadavg regardless of what the kernel gives us...
 *
 * Revision 1.20  2002/08/02 22:44:00  alan
 * Enhanced an error message when we get a name/value (NV) failure.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  2002/07/08 04:14:12  alan
 * Updated comments in the front of various files.
 * Removed Matt's Solaris fix (which seems to be illegal on Linux).
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2002/04/13 22:35:08  alan
 * Changed ha_msg_add_nv to take an end pointer to make it safer.
 * Added a length parameter to string2msg so it would be safer.
 * Changed the various networking plugins to use the new string2msg().
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2002/04/07 13:54:06  alan
 * This is a pretty big set of changes ( > 1200 lines in plain diff)
 *
 * The following major bugs have been fixed
 *  - STONITH operations are now a precondition for taking over
 *    resources from a dead machine
 *
 *  - Resource takeover events are now immediately terminated when shutting
 *    down - this keeps resources from being held after shutting down
 *
 *  - heartbeat could sometimes fail to start due to how it handled its
 *    own status through two different channels.  I restructured the handling
 *    of local status so that it's now handled almost exactly like handling
 *    the status of remote machines
 *
 * There is evidence that all these serious bugs have been around a long time,
 * even though they are rarely (if ever) seen.
 *
 * The following minor bugs have been fixed:
 *
 *  - the standby test now retries during transient conditions...
 *
 *  - the STONITH code for the test method "ssh" now uses "at" to schedule
 *    the stonith operation on the other node so it won't hang when using
 *    newer versions of ssh.
 *
 * The following new test was added:
 *  - SimulStart - starting all nodes ~ simultaneously
 *
 * The following significant restructuring of the code occurred:
 *
 *  - Completely rewrote the process management and death-of-child code to
 *    be uniform, and be based on a common semi-object-oriented approach
 *    The new process tracking code is very general, and I consider it to
 *    be part of the plumbing for the OCF.
 *
 *  - Completely rewrote the event handling code to be based on the Glib
 *    mainloop paradigm. The sets of "inputs" to the main loop are:
 *     - "polled" events like signals, and once-per-loop occurrances
 *     - messages from the cluster and users
 *     - API registration requests from potential clients
 *     - API calls from clients
 *
 *
 * The following minor changes were made:
 *
 *  - when nice_failback is taking over resources, since we always negotiate for
 *    taking them over, so we no longer have a timeout waiting for the other
 *    side to reply.  As a result, the timeout for waiting for the other
 *    side is now much longer than it was.
 *
 *  - transient errors for standby operations now print WARN instead of EROR
 *
 *  - The STONITH and standby tests now don't print funky output to the
 *    logs.
 *
 *  - added a new file TESTRESULTS.out for logging "official" test results.
 *
 * Groundwork was laid for the following future changes:
 *  - merging the control and master status processes
 *
 *  - making a few other things not wait for process completion in line
 *
 *  - creating a comprehensive asynchronous action structure
 *
 *  - getting rid of the "interface" kludge currently used for tracking
 *    activity on individual interfaces
 *
 * The following things still need to be tested:
 *
 *  - STONITH testing (including failures)
 *
 *  - clock jumps
 *
 *  - protocol retransmissions
 *
 *  - cross-version compatability of status updates (I added a new field)
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2002/03/27 02:10:22  alan
 * Finished (hopefully) the last bug fix.  Now it won't complain
 * if it authenticates a packet without a sequence number.  This was kinda
 * dumb anyway.  I know packets go out w/o seq numbers...
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2002/03/15 14:26:36  alan
 * Added code to help debug the current missing to/from/ts/,etc. problem...
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2001/10/25 14:17:28  alan
 * Changed a few of the errors into warnings.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2001/10/24 20:46:28  alan
 * A large number of patches.  They are in these categories:
 * 	Fixes from Matt Soffen
 * 	Fixes to test environment things - including changing some ERRORs to
 * 		WARNings and vice versa.
 * 	etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/09/29 19:08:24  alan
 * Wonderful security and error correction patch from Emily Ratliff
 * 	<ratliff@austin.ibm.com>
 * Fixes code to have strncpy() calls instead of strcpy calls.
 * Also fixes the number of arguments to several functions which were wrong.
 * Many thanks to Emily.
 *
