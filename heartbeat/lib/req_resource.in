#	This code is the "ask nicely" case for when we first start up a node.
#	The case of the other node failing or being dead when we start up
#	is handled by mach_down which invokes takegroup just like we do
#	except it never asks for permission.
#
#	The nice_failback = yes ($HA_NICEFAILBACK) case coordinates things
#	so always know the other guy doesn't have the resources before we
#	get here, so we don't need to ever wait in that case...
#
#	If no one else is up, then we set HA_DONTASK in the environment.
#	It is possible that the TIMEOUT case should be removed now...
#	This is a failsafe case, but it's kind of a dangerous failsafe
#	case...
