#
#	New haresources format:
#
#	machine resource resource resource resource
#
#	Where a resource can be an IP address or a scriptname, or a scriptname
#	and single argument.
#
#	When it's a scriptname with an argument, the argument is connected to
#	the scriptname with "::".  Another way of expressing an IP address is
#	via IPaddr::ip-address, since the script name IPaddr is the one assumed
#	for resources which are spelled like an IP address.
#
#	As an illustration, the following two lines are identical in effect:
#
#	node1	123.45.67.89 httpd
#	node1	IPaddr::123.45.67.89 httpd
#
#       One can also pass multiple arguments to a script by separating each
#       argument with a double colon:
#
#       node1  10.0.0.170 Filesystem::/dev/sda1::/data1::ext2
#
#	Note:  The first resource on the line must be unique in the haresources
#	file.  Maybe I should add a resource type called Unique which can
#	put on the front of a line to meet this requirement.

#	Revision 1.32  2005/09/20 15:54:39  alan
#	Fixed a bug where resource start failure would cause resources to never be taken over by anyone
#	It now does an hb_standby all if a start failure occurs.
#	The only danger with this is that it might cause both local and foreign
#	resources to go offline if only one of the two is broken and it loops indefinitely
#	swapping resources between the two...

#	Fixed a bug introduced by last fix.
#	This new bug was pointed out by Kenneth Geisshirt <kenneth@geisshirt.dk>

#	
#	Revision 1.11  2003/07/22 09:50:23  alan
#	Added code to pay attention more to return codes in ResourceManager,
