 *
 * This plugin is intended to provide an interface to the
 * apphbd so that when an application misses a heartbeat an 
 * external executable can be notified.  This external component
 * can then fork a process to restart the application, or
 * preform other actions when an application misses a heartbeat
 * (or otherwise causes the apphbd to generate an event for it).
 *
 * The plugin permits the recovery component to be separate
 * from the apphbd.  Thus the forking of processes and recovery
 * is done outside the apphbd.  The recovery component will
 * need to be registered with the apphbd like any other 
 * application. However, it should be recovered differently.
 *
 * We will probably need a special case in apphb to handle
 * recovery of the recovery manager.  In this implementation
 * the plugin (i.e. apphbd) is a client of the recovery 
 * manager) thus, if the recovery manager dies, the 
 * plugin can no longer forward recovery requests to it
 * until *something* restarts it.
