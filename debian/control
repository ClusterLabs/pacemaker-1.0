Description: Monitors virtual services provided by LVS
 ldirectord is a stand-alone daemon to monitor services of real
 for virtual services provided by The Linux Virtual Server
 (http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/). It is simple to install
 and works with the heartbeat code (http://www.linux-ha.org/).

Description: Interface for remotely powering down a node in the cluster
 The STONITH module (a.k.a. STOMITH) provides an extensible interface for
 remotely powering down a node in the cluster.  The idea is quite simple:
 When the software running on one machine wants to make sure another
 machine in the cluster is not using a resource, pull the plug on the
 other machine. It's simple and reliable, albeit admittedly brutal.

Description: Plugin and Interface Loading System
 PILS is an generalized and portable open source Plugin and Interface
 Loading System. PILS was developed as part of the Open Cluster Framework
 reference implementation, and is designed to be directly usable by a wide
 variety of other applications.  PILS manages both plugins (loadable
 objects), and the interfaces these plugins implement.  PILS is designed to
 support any number of plugins implementing any number of interfaces.

Description: Subsystem for High-Availability Linux
 heartbeat is a basic heartbeat subsystem for Linux-HA.
 It will run scripts at initialisation, and when machines go up or down.
 This version will also perform IP address takeover using gratuitous ARPs.
 It works correctly for a 2-node configuration, and is extensible to larger
 configurations.
 It implements the following kinds of heartbeats:
   * Bidirectional Serial Rings ("raw" serial ports)
   * UDP/IP broadcast (ethernet, etc)
