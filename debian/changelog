pacemaker (1.0.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Increased versioned build-depend on heartbeat-dev and
    depend of pacemaker on heartbeat to 2.99.2+sles11r3-1
    so that crmd is built against and uses liblrm.so.2

  * Include var/* in pacemaker package

  * Add dependency on the following virtual packages provided by heartbeat.
    This is to ensure that if the versions of these libraries increase
    this version of pacemaker will conflict with the new heartbeat package
    - libapphb2, liblrm2, libpils2, libplumb2, libstonith1

  * Changes made while producing Debian packages
  + Change distribution from sid to experimental
  + Remove autoconf automake autoheader on clean as these
    end up as symlinks which dpkg-source can't handle
  + Remove libltdl.tar on as this is a binary which dpkg-source can't handle
  + Make sure configure and py-compile are executable if present
  + Remove build-stamp on clean, otherwise the package can't be rebuilt
  + Remove lib64 path mangling code from configure,
    it seems to be broken on Debian
  + Use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles
    - Remove debian/*.files debian/*.dirs
      These files are not needed, as debian/*.install is used.
      They should be removed from upstream.  
  + Use dh_clean and dh_auto_clean in clean target of debian/rules
  + Use dh_prep instead of dh_clean in build target of debian/rules
