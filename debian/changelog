  * Restrurctured  provides, conflicts and replaces

heartbeat-2 (2.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uptream initally made the wrong tar ball avaliable for
    2.0.1 and this was used to build 2.0.1-1.
    I have asked 2.0.1-1 not to be accepted into the Debian Archive
    for this reason. 2.0.1-2 uses the updated, correct tarball from
    upstream.

  * Note that this package has a binary dependancy on libssl
    only because of linking against libsnmp9 (5.2.1.2-3)

  * Add build dependancy on libsensors-dev (for libsnmp9)

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Sep 2005 12:56:11 +0900

  * Temporarly remove the drac3 module as GPL code that links
    against OpenSSL is not acceptable to Debian.

heartbeat-2 (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream

  * Added --enable-checkpointd to configure arguments
  * Added --disable-snmp-subagent to configure arguments
  * Added --disable-swig to configure arguments
  * Add build dependancy on uuid-dev
  * Readranged packages to allow heartbeat 1.2.X to exist in debian
    and heartebat 2.X to be heartbeat-2 until heartbeat-2 gets
    a bit more testing in the wild. Also consoldidated binary
    packages into heartbaet-2, and development packages into
    heartbeat-2-dev, ldirectord is still in its own package,
    ldirectord2, as it drags in a lot of dependancies that
    no other part of the system uses.

heartbeat (1.2.2-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove build dependancy on ssh as the package has ongoing
    install problems on arm and this is preventing this package
    from moving into sarge. Instead, provide configure options
    to specify the path to ssh and scp.

heartbeat (1.2.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

heartbeat (1.2.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  *  The previous version never made it into testing because
     the build failed on arm because the ssh package was broken
     at the time. I have not had any luck contacting someone to
     rebuild the package.
  *  Updated ldirectord to 1.77.2.4 (from 1.77.2.2).
     Fixes a problem where real servers present in multiple
     virtuals would only be added to one virtual service.

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Jun 2004 17:01:26 +0900

    (closes: Bug#188835) (closes: Bug#249606)
  * Put the prioroty of all packages, except ldirectord back to optional

heartbeat (1.2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

    (actually fixed in 1.2.2-2) (closes: Bug#222712)

    long interface names. Use IPadd2, which used the ip command,
    instead.  (Fixed in upstream) (closes: Bug#229978)
  * New upstream (closes: Bug#248611)
  * Heartbeat package does not use debconf anymore
    (Fixed a while ago) (closes: Bug#189932)

    (closes: Bug#207607)
  * Made dependancy on libnet1-dev instead of 
    libnet1-dev | libnet0-dev | libnet-dev.
    - libnet0-dev is in setction oldlibs in stable
    - allows IPv6addr to be included.
  * Include IPv6addr
  * Made dependancy on libssl-dev instead of libssl-dev | libssl09-dev
    as libssl09-dev is not in stable.
  * Changed priority to extra as that is the lowest common 
    denominator of our dependancies.

  * ldirectord check_ftp no longer uses pipes. (closes: Bug#243157)
  * The binary-arch and binary-indep targets did not conform to Debian policy.
    It is rather difficult to implement them correctly given the heartbeat
    build system, and the policy allows them not to exist. (closes: Bug#188835)
  * Added dependancy on libmail-imapclient-perl. (closes: Bug#242077)
  * The timestamp overflow was fixed long time ago.
    (closes: Bug#239683) (closes: Bug#239687)

  * Make libstonith0 depend on libsnmp5. Thanks Stefan Beck for noticing.
    (Closes: #228544)
  * Make libstonith0 depend on libssl0.9.7. Why the f*ck does dpkg-shlibdeps
    not find these?
  * Make heartbeat start later and stop sooner (S75 and K05) so that it
    won't f*ck drbd. Thanks Stefan Schleifer for noticing.
    Created a debconf template to ask if the change should be done when
    upgrading from previous versions.
  * Fixed debconf template text for directory movement.

heartbeat (0.4.9.0l-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * taking package after talking to Paolo Molaro - well I was really lazy
    cause it took me a lot of time to create a working new package, but I
    hope the debconf interface was worth the waiting ...
  * Updated for 0.4.9.0l
  * modified package to fit policy 3.5.3.0
  * added Build Depends
  * added debconf support for heartbeat
  * wrote a very short manpage for stonith and meatclient

heartbeat (0.4.6-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix ugly bug with prerm (Closes: bug#56671). To the release manager:
    get this in potato as that bug is really annoying (endless loop
    with the yes program when uninstalling). You still need to kill or Crtl-C
    the prerm script, as it seems it's not possible to override
    a broken prerm script before it's run by dpkg.
  * Applied little patch from Terry Katz to make IPAddr work correctly
    with multiple similar IPs on the same pc (Closes: bug#55925).
