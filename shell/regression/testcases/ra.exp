.TRY RA interface
.INP: ra
.INP: providers IPaddr
heartbeat
.INP: providers Dummy
heartbeat pacemaker
.INP: info IPaddr
Manages virtual IPv4 addresses (portable version) (ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr)

This script manages IP alias IP addresses
It can add an IP alias, or remove one.

Parameters (* denotes required, [] the default):

ip* (string): IPv4 address
    The IPv4 address to be configured in dotted quad notation, for example
    "192.168.1.1".

nic (string, [eth0]): Network interface
    The base network interface on which the IP address will be brought
    online.
    
    If left empty, the script will try and determine this from the
    routing table.
    
    Do NOT specify an alias interface in the form eth0:1 or anything here;
    rather, specify the base interface only.
    
    Prerequisite:
    
    There must be at least one static IP address, which is not managed by
    the cluster, assigned to the network interface.
    
    If you can not assign any static IP address on the interface,
    modify this kernel parameter:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.promote_secondaries=1
    (or per device)

cidr_netmask (string): Netmask
    The netmask for the interface in CIDR format. (ie, 24), or in
    dotted quad notation  255.255.255.0).
    
    If unspecified, the script will also try to determine this from the
    routing table.

broadcast (string): Broadcast address
    Broadcast address associated with the IP. If left empty, the script will
    determine this from the netmask.

iflabel (string): Interface label
    You can specify an additional label for your IP address here.

lvs_support (boolean, [false]): Enable support for LVS DR
    Enable support for LVS Direct Routing configurations. In case a IP
    address is stopped, only move it to the loopback device to allow the
    local node to continue to service requests, but no longer advertise it
    on the network.

local_stop_script (string): 
    Script called when the IP is released

local_start_script (string): 
    Script called when the IP is added

ARP_INTERVAL_MS (integer, [500]): milliseconds between gratuitous ARPs
    milliseconds between ARPs

ARP_REPEAT (integer, [10]): repeat count
    How many gratuitous ARPs to send out when bringing up a new address

ARP_BACKGROUND (boolean, [yes]): run in background
    run in background (no longer any reason to do this)

ARP_NETMASK (string, [ffffffffffff]): netmask for ARP
    netmask for ARP - in nonstandard hexadecimal format.

Operations' defaults (advisory minimum):

    start         timeout=20s
    stop          timeout=20s
    monitor       interval=5s timeout=20s
.INP: info stonith:external/ssh
ssh STONITH device (stonith:external/ssh)

ssh-based Linux host reset
Fine for testing, but not suitable for production!
Only reboot action supported, no poweroff, and, surprisingly enough, no poweron.

Parameters (* denotes required, [] the default):

hostlist* (string): Hostlist
    The list of hosts that the STONITH device controls

livedangerously (enum): Live Dangerously!!
    Set to "yes" if you want to risk your system's integrity.
    Of course, since this plugin isn't for production, using it
    in production at all is a bad idea.  On the other hand,
    setting this parameter to yes makes it an even worse idea.
    Viva la Vida Loca!

stonith-timeout (time, [60s]): 
    How long to wait for the STONITH action to complete. Overrides the stonith-timeout cluster property

priority (integer, [0]): 
    The priority of the stonith resource. The lower the number, the higher the priority.

Operations' defaults (advisory minimum):

    start         timeout=60
    stop          timeout=15
    status        timeout=60
    monitor       interval=3600 timeout=60
