linux-ha plugin for TSA README


1. REQUIREMENTS
    Compiling the TSA plugin requires various software packages. 
First of all you need to install the Java SDK software. You also 
need the TSA software including the rsct, sam and sam.adapter. 
Although in theory the plugin only depends on the sam.adapter, 
not installing the sam package will prevent you from installing 
the sam.adapter package due to the dependency between the 
sam.adater RPM and the sam RPM. Therefor you might have to 
install all of them.
   The SWIG is also used to generate the interface files at the
compling time.
   Running the TSA plugin requires the Java runtime environment 
and the sam.adapater package.

2. COMPILING THE PLUGIN
    To build the TSA plugin, apply the --enable-tsa-plugin option:
	./ConfigureMe bootstrap --enable-tsa-plugin=yes
    Options --with-java-home and --with-tsa-dir and optional. The 
--with-java-home option specifies the Java sdk directory and the 
--with-tsa-dir option specifies the TSA directory. If they are not 
presented, the configuration will try to find the Java sdk directory 
and set the TSA directory to /opt/IBM/tsamp. By default, the TSA 
software is installed to /opt/IBM/tsamp. So usually you don't need 
the --with-tsa-dir option but you often need to present the 
--with-java-home option. 
    For example:
	./ConfigureMe bootstrap --enable-tsa-plugin=yes \
	--with-java-home=/opt/IBMJava2-141

3. CONFIGURATION
    First, you need to add the apiauth directives as follows to 
the ha.cf to allow the plugin to sign on to heartbeat:
	apiauth         tsa uid=root gid=root
	apiauth         tsad uid=root gid=root

    You will need a startup script like /usr/bin/samadapter to 
start the plugin. You don't need to write it from scratch. The 
simple way is to modify the samadapter script for the linux-ha
plugin:
	cp /usr/bin/samadapter /usr/bin/linuxha-samadapter 
    then edit /usr/bin/linuxha-samadapter and append 
":$plib/linuxhafla.jar" to the end of line 365. This tells the 
adapter to load the linux-ha plugin when it starts.
    Besides, you need to edit the plugin config file:
/etc/opt/IBM/tsamp/sam/cfg/sam.adapter.plugin.properties
and set the value of plugin-impl-class to 
org.linuxha.sam.plugin.LinuxHAPlugin. For example:
	plugin-impl-class = org.linuxha.sam.plugin.LinuxHAPlugin
This tells the adapater to use the linux-ha plugin.


4. START AND STOP THE PLUGIN   
   To start the plugin:
	/usr/lib/heartbeat/tsa_eventd &
        /usr/bin/linuxha-samadapter start

   To stop the plugin:
	/usr/bin/linuxha-samadapter stop
        /usr/lib/heartbeat/tsa_eventd -k
