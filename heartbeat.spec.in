%description
@HB_PKG@ is a basic high-availability subsystem for Linux-HA.
It will run scripts at initialization, and when machines go up or down.
This version will also perform IP address takeover using gratuitous ARPs.
It supports "n-node" clusters with significant capabilities for managing
resources and dependencies.

In addition it continues to support the older release 1 style of
2-node clustering.

It implements the following kinds of heartbeats:
	- Serial ports
	- UDP/IP multicast (ethernet, etc)
	- UDP/IP broadcast (ethernet, etc)
	- UDP/IP heartbeats
	- "ping" heartbeats (for routers, switches, etc.)
	   (to be used for breaking ties in 2-node systems)

%description ldirectord
ldirectord is a stand-alone daemon to monitor services of real 
for virtual services provided by The Linux Virtual Server
(http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/). It is simple to install 
and works with the heartbeat code (http://www.linux-ha.org/).

%description stonith
The STONITH module (a.k.a. STOMITH) provides an extensible interface
for remotely powering down a node in the cluster.  The idea is quite simple:
When the software running on one machine wants to make sure another
machine in the cluster is not using a resource, pull the plug on the other 
machine. It's simple and reliable, albeit admittedly brutal.

%description pils
PILS is an generalized and portable open source
Plugin and Interface Loading System.
PILS was developed as part of the Open Cluster Framework
reference implementation, and is designed
to be directly usable by a wide variety of other applications.
PILS manages both plugins (loadable objects),
and the interfaces these plugins implement.
PILS is designed to support any number of plugins
implementing any number of interfaces.

%changelog
* Sun May 21 2006  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.6 - bug fix release
  + Fixed a long-standing problem where the .src.rpms weren't usable across
	32/64-bit boundaries
  + Added the ability to start/stop groups from the GUI
  + Fixed a few monitoring bugs in the Apache resource agent
  + Changed the name of the netmask parameter to the IPaddr and IPaddr2
	resource agents.  This is because the netmask must be specified
	in CIDR format.  The new name is cidr_netmask.  It will continue
	to work the old way.
  + Changed target_role so that when you stop a resource, all the resources
	which depend on it also stop - all in the proper order.
  + KNOWN LIMITATIONS and BUGS
    + the GUI core dumps when run using AIX-based X servers

* Sun Apr 23 2006  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.5 - significant bug fixes and a few feature deficits fixed
  + various portability fixes
  + enable GUI to run with pygtk 2.4
  + significant GUI improvements and speedups
  + numerous logging improvements (generally much quieter)
  + speed up CIB processing by writing it to disk asynchronously
  + add CIB on-disk checksums
  + removed dependency on openssl
  + added "failure stickiness" to the CIB/CRM
  + Several fixes to the membership code
  + We now log all output from resource agents
  + fixed STONITHd memory leaks.
  + Added an OCF RA for Xen guests
  + Added email alerts to ldirectord
  + Improvements to the haresources2cib upgrade tool
  + Several fixes to cibadmin
  + Fix some autoadd-related bugs
  + Added Chinese support to the GUI
  + Added a daemon to replace and generalize ipfail
    + Limited testing only
  + Significant improvements to CIM model, including modifying things
  + Extensive Master/slave testing and fixes
  + Use a digest of the parameters used in an action (smaller CIB)
  + Improved detection of "old" events that should be ignored by the PE
    (ensures resource monitoring is active when required)
  + Better detection of required and/or optimal behaviour in mixed
    (and formerly mixed) clusters
  + LRM now supports multiple concurrent monitor operations
  + Optional startup & runtime enforcement of DTD validation
    (Invalid changes are rejected)
  + cibadmin tool overhauled and verified to function correctly
  + Some depreciated CIB features now unsupported
    + Placing nvpair objects in crm_config (must now use cluster_property_set)
    + on_stopfail removed in favor of setting on_fail in the resource's stop operation
    + start_prereq removed in favor of setting prereq in the resource's start operation
  + Minimum required version for performing a rolling upgrade of a
    crm yes" cluster to 2.0.5 is 2.0.4
  + Changed traditional_compression to default to NO.  This new default
	is not compatible in mixed clusters running version 2.0.0-2.0.2.
	If you are upgrading a CRM-based cluster to >= 2.0.5, you
	have to go through 2.0.4 anyway (for other reasons), so this
	shouldn't cause any additional difficulties.
	Non-CRM clusters shouldn't be affected by this because only
	CRM packets are large enough to be compressed.

  + Keep CCM from core dumping when certain conditions occur which
	cannot be recovered from.

    + Refine shutdown detection
    + Review and fix the contents and timing of CIB updates that are required

    + Ask Heartbeat for a list of known nodes and use it to populate the <nodes>
      section in the CIB
    + Stop the CRM shutting down all active resources at exit

    + Write out the CIB asynchronously
* Fri Feb 10 2006  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.3 - Bug fixes and significant new features.
  + Management Daemon/Library and GUI client
    + provide a management library for manamgement daemon and CIM provider
    + provide a management daemon and a basic GUI management tool
  + CIM enablement
    + CIM (Common Information Model) enablement - works with
      sblim-sfcb, OpenWBEM, and Pegasus CIMOMs
    - not yet compiled into our binary RPMs because of dependencies
  + CRM (Cluster Resource Manager) General
    + All shutdowns go via the PE/TE - preserves inter-resource ordering
    + Support for future changes to the CIB (depreciation of cib_fragment)
    + Overhaul of IPC and HA channel callback logic
    + Many improvments to the quality and quantity (reduced) of logging
  + CRMd
    + Timerless elections - when everyone has voted we're done
    + Use the replace notification from the CIB to re-update our copy with 
      our view of our peers.
    + Reliably detect if the LRM connection is still active.
    + Elections
      + newer versions defer to older ones in DC elections 
        (opposite of current behavior)
      + this means that only once the complete cluster has been upgraded will
        we start acting like the new version and accept new config options
      + it also means newer PE's and TE's (the most complex pieces) don't need
        "act like the old version" options and can rely on all slaves being at
        least as up-to-date as they are
      + people can run mixed clusters as long as they want
        (until they want the new PE features)
      + new DCs only update the version number in the CIB if they have a 
        higher value
      + nodes that start and have a lower version than that stored in the CIB
        shut themselves down (the CRM part anyway)
      + this prevents an admin from introducing old nodes back into an upgraded
        cluster. It probably doesn't fully understand the config and may not
        support the actions the PE/TE requires.
  + CIB (Common Information Base daemon)
    + Make sure "query only" connections cant modify the CIB
    + Periodically dump some stats about what the CIB has been doing.
    + Verify there are no memory leaks
    + Performance enhancements
    + Prevent a single CIB client from blocking everyone else
    + Clients Can be notified of full CIB replacements
    + record_config_changes option in ha.cf for those worried about 
      the amount of logging.  Defaults to "on".
    + suppress_cib_writes CIB option replaced with in enable_config_writes ha.cf 
      (enable_config_writes to be removed in 2.0.4)
    + Never write the status section to disk
    + Check permissions for the on-disk CIB at startup
    + Dont trash unreadable on-disk CIBs
    + Fix for updates made against the whole CIB (not just one section) 
  + PEngine (Policy Engine)
    + Many improvements to the handling of resource groups
    + Support "anonymous" clones
    + Fix stonith ordering
    + Order DC shutdowns after everyone else's
    + Support short resource names (for group and clone resources)
    + The ordering and colocation of grouped resources is now optional
    + Support probing new nodes for active resources.
    + All "probe" actions are controlled by the PE.
      + No resource may be started until the probing is complete.
      + Do not probe for resources we know to be active on unprobed nodes
    + When looking for monitor ops, only mark it optional if it was already
      active on the node we're interested in.
    + Detect changes to class/type/provider/parameters and force a restart
      of the resource
    + New record_pengine_inputs option in ha.cf for those worried about 
      the amount of logging.  Defaults to "on".
    + Differentiate between config and processing errors
      + reduces the frequency that we need to log the complete CIB
    + Make notify for master/slave work
    + New CIB option: stop_orphan_actions (boolean)
      If a resource is no longer defined, we can optionally stop it
    + New CIB option: stop_orphan_actions (boolean)
      If a monitor op for a given interval is no longer defined, we can
      optionally stop it
    + Add support for time and phase-of-the-moon based constraints
    + Improved failure handling: avoiding false positives
    + Always create orphaned resources - so they show up in crm_mon
    + Do not require sequential clone numbers starting at 0
  + TEngine (transition engine)
    + Detect old stonith ops
  + CLIs (Command Line interfaces)
    + Create a --one-shot option for crm_mon
    + Switch a number of CLI tools to use the new syncronous connections
    + Log errors to stderr where they will be seen and therefore useful
    + Support migration and un-migration of resources and resource groups
    + Create crm_verify for checking configuration validity
    + Simplify the passing of XML to cibadmin
  + Known open bugs worth mentioning:
    + 1075, 1080, 1081, 1084, 1085, 1064, 1069, 756, 984
    + 1050, 1082, 1037, 1079
    

* Thu Sep 22 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.2 - small bug fix only release
  + Fixed a bug in ping directive - it works again
  + Added a check to BasicSanityCheck to check ping and ping_group directives
  + fixed cl_status nodestatus to return 0 if a node has status "ping"
  + fixed a memory leak in the CRM's LRM interface code
  + fixed code which deterimines which version of the CRM becomes
    the DC when basic CIB schema versions differ.  It now prefers
    the older version to be DC instead of the newer version.

* Wed Sep 14 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.1 - 
  + Communication Layer
    + netstring encoding format is changed to be more efficient
    + add compression capability for big messages
  + Add man pages for hb_standby/hb_takeover	
  + The assert triggered by 2.0.0 has been fixed
  + CIB can now contain XML comments and/or be in DOS format	
  + Includes implementation of the ISO8601 date format
  + New CLI tools for changing cluster preferences, node attributes 
    and node standby
  + Improved recovery and placement of group resources
  + Detection of failed nodes by the Policy Engine is fixed
  + New Policy Engine features 
    http://www.linux-ha.org/ClusterResourceManager/DTD1.0/Annotated :
      sections 1.5.[8,9,10,12]
    + Constraints and instance attributes can now be active conditionally
    + Rules can now contain other rules
    + Date/Time based expressions are supported
    + Cloned resources can now optionally be notified before and after
      any of its peers are stopped or started.
    + The cluster can re-evaluate the configuration automatically after
      a defined interval of idleness
  + Removed a flow control message which was very annoying when operating
    in a mixed 1.x/2.x environment
  -- Known Bugs :-( --
    - Bug 859 - FSA took too long to complete action - fully recovered from
    - Bug 882 - IPC channel not connected during shutdown - harmless
    - Bug 879 - Failed actions cause extra election - harmless
 Each of these occurs about once or twice in 5000 test iterations
       - This is probably > 10K failovers
    - rsc_location constraints cannot have rules that contain other rules
      (fixed in CVS after release) 
* Fri Jul 29 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.0 - First stable release of the next generation of the Linux-HA project
  + Basic Characteristics described here:
	http://linux-ha.org/FactSheetv2
  + Core infrastructure improvments:
    + Messaging (message acknowledging and flow control)
    + Logging   (logging daemon)
  + Release 1.x style (2-node) clusters fully supported
  + Multi-node support (so far up to 16-node clusters tested)
	See http://linux-ha.org/GettingStartedV2 for more information
  + New components:
    + Cluster Information Base    (replicated resource configuration)
    + Cluster Resource Manager    (supporting 1->N nodes)
    + Modular Policy Engine       (controlling resource placement)
    + Local Resource Manager      (policy free, not cluster aware)
    + Stonith Daemon              (stand-alone fencing  subsytem)
  + Support for OCF and LSB resource agents
  + Support for composite resource types (groups, clones)
  + Support for a rich set of resource location and ordering constraints
  + Conversion tool for existing haresources
  + Resources monitored by request
  + Resource "maintenance" mode
  + Several failback, failure and "No Quorum" behaviours to choose from
        (global defaults and per action or resource)
  + Sample cluster state and configuration monitoring tools

  Known issues in 2.0.0:
    - Under some rare circumstances the cluster manager will time out
      while stabilizing a new cluster state.  This appears to be
	otherwise harmless - the cluster is actually fine.
	http://www.osdl.org/developer_bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=770
    - Under some rare circumstances, a dev assert will be triggered
	in unpack.c.  This results in the pengine getting restarted.
	This is annoying, but not a disaster.
	http://www.osdl.org/developer_bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=797

	more about this effort. Please examine crm/README, crm/test/README
	and crm/crm-1.0.dtd for example usage and configuration.
  + Also included is the L(ocal) R(esource) M(anager) developed by IBM China
	which is an integral part of the NewHeartbeatDesign.
  + Known caveats:
    - STONITH as a whole has seen a code cleanup and should be tested
      carefully.
    - The external STONITH plug-in has undergone major surgery and
      probably doesn't work yet.
    - the new CRM is not perfectly stable with 3 nodes yet.

* Tue Feb 16 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.2.0
  + Replaced the nice_failback option with the auto_failback option.
	THIS OBSOLETES THE NICE_FAILBACK OPTION. READ THE DOCS FOR HOW
	TO UPGRADE SMOOTHLY.
  + Added a new feature to hb_standby which allows you to give up
	  any specific category of resources:  local, foreign, or all.
	The old behavior is "all" which is the default.
	This allows you to put a auto_failback no cluster into
	  an active/active configuration on demand.
  + ipfail now works properly with auto_failback on (active/active)
  + ipfail now has "hysteresis" so that it doesn't respond immediately
	to a network failure, but waits a little while so that the
	damage can be properly assessed and extraneous takeovers avoided
  + Added new ping node timeout directive "deadping"
  + Made sure heartbeat preallocated stack and heap, and printed a
	message if we allocate heap once we're started up...
  + IPMILan STONITH plugin added to CVS
  + Added IPaddr2 resource script
  + Made the APC smart UPS ups code compatible with more UPSes
  + Added a (preliminary?) ordered messaging facility from Yi Zhu
  + Changed IPaddr's method of doing ARPs in background so that

* Tue Feb 10 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.5
  + ipfail now has "hysteresis" so that it doesn't respond immediately
	to a network failure, but waits a little while so that the
	damage can be properly assessed and extraneous takeovers avoided
  + Several fixes to cl_poll()
  + More fixes to the IPC code - especially handling data reception
	after EOF
  + removed some unclean code from GSource for treating EOF conditions
  + Several bugs concerning hanging when shutting down early during startup
  + A few BasicSanityCheck bug fixes
  + CTS now allows a single machine to be able to monitor several clusters
  + Most former CTS options are now either unneeded or on the command line

  + Fixed uncommon (authorization) memory leak
  + Some Solaris portability fixes.
  + Made init script handle standby correctly for new config files
  + Improved the fast failure detection test
  + Added some backwards compatibility for nice_failback and some default
	authentication directives
  + Corrected the 1.1.4 change log
  

* Fri Jan 22 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.4
  + ipfail now works properly with auto_failback on (active/active)
  + Changed the API to use sockets (IPC library) instead of FIFOs.
  + Added new apiauth directives to provide authorization information
	formerly provided by the FIFO permissions.
  + Added Intel's implementation of the SAF data checkpointing API and daemon
  + Added a cleanup suggested by Emily Ratliff.
  + IPMILan STONITH plugin added to CVS
  + Added IPaddr2 resource script
  + Various cleanups due to horms.
  + Fixed authentication to work on 64-bit platforms(!)
  + Fixed the cl_poll() code to handle corner cases better
  + Made heartbeat close watchdog device before re-execing itself
  + New CTS improvements from Mi, Jun <jun.mi@intel.com>
  + Various minor bug fixes.
      . Several shutdown bugs addressed
      . fixed sendarp to make a pid file, so we can shut it down
          when we shut everything else down in case it's still running.
      . Lots of minor bug fixes to IPC code
      . Lots of minor bug fixes to ipctest program
      . made BasicSanityCheck more tolerant of delays
      . Fixed IPC code to authenticate based on ints, not int*s.
      . Check properly for strnlen instead of strlen...
      . Several signed/unsigned fixes
      . A few uninitialized vars now are inited
      . Switched to compiling lex/yacc sources the automake way
      . Lots of minor CTS fixes...

  + ldirectord bug fixes:
    . When new real servers are added on initialisation or when
        the configuration file is reread they are marked with status
        of -1 (uninitialised) so they will be checked and inserted
        into the virtual service as required
    . All checks use the checkport if set, otherwise the port set for
        the individual real server. This was the case for http and
        connect checks, but others had variations on this theme.
    . When the configuration file is reread because it changed
        on disk and autoreload is set, check the real servers
        immediately rather than waiting for checkinterval to expire
    . Already running message sent to stderr instead of stdout
    . Support alternate server in real-server specific URL
    . Treat the same real server with different weights as a different
        real server. Fixes bug reported by Philip Hayward whereby the same
        real-server would always have the same weight, regardless of
        the ldirectord.cf

  +  Made it compliant with the FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)
  +  Fixed IP address takeover so we can take over on non-eth0 interface

  + Preliminary "Getting Started" document by Rudy Pawul
  + Improved the /proc/ha code
  + Fixed memory leak associated with serial ports, and problem with return
	of control to the "master" node.

+ Version 0.3.2
  + Added UDP/PPP bidirectional serial ring heartbeat
	(PPP ensures data integrity on the serial links)
  + fixed a stupid bug which caused shutdown to give unpredictable
	results
  + added timestamps to /var/log/ha-log messages
  + fixed a couple of other minor oversights.

* Sun May 10 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
+ Version 0.3.1
  + Make ChangeLog file from RPM specfile
  + Made ipresources only install in the DOC directory as a sample

* Sun May 09 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
+ Version 0.3.0
  + Added UDP broadcast heartbeat (courtesy of Tom Vogt)
  + Significantly restructured code making it easier to add heartbeat media
  + added new directives to config file:
    + udp interface-name
    + udpport port-number
    + baud    serial-baud-rate
  + made manual daemon shutdown easier (only need to kill one)
  + moved the sample ha.cf file to the Doc directory

* Sat Mar 27 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
+ Version 0.2.0
  + Make an RPM out of it
  + Integrated IP address takeover gotten from Horms
  + Added support to tickle a watchdog timer whenever our heart beats
  + Integrated enough basic code to allow a 2-node demo to occur
  + Integrated patches from Andrew Hildebrand <andrew@pdi.com> to allow it
    to run under IRIX.
  - Known Bugs
    - Only supports 2-node clusters
    - Only supports a single IP interface per node in the cluster
    - Doesn't yet include Tom Vogt's ethernet heartbeat code
    - No documentation
    - Not very useful yet :-)
