This code isn't really ready for anyone except the brave, or the foolish :-).
We're still learning a lot about doing /proc things in Linux, and have a bit
more to learn before declaring this production.

If you're brave, or a kernel hacker, you're welcome to try this out, but there
are no guarantees that it won't crash your system, destroy your data,
or burn your toast.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

	Known bugs:

	1) General lack of thorough testing
	2) SEGV when trying to read the heartbeat.
	3) "rmmod ha" needs to remove nodes, resources, etc. before
		going out of business.
	4) It is not yet integrated with the user-level heartbeat code.
		(I think Volker has something for this, but I don't have
		it yet).
	Look for all these to be fixed in the next version.

On the other hand, if you really ARE brave, you are more than welcome to help
us out in our efforts and send us the patches that make it work exactly right.

Here are the first fruits of Volker Wiegand's hard work on making a /proc/ha
module for controlling and displaying Linux-HA via /proc.


If you haven't paid any attention to the warnings above, stop and read no more.

Otherwise, if you really want to go on...

To compile it:
	make
To install it:
	insmod ha.o
